## Effectiveness

Showcasing the product to the client resulted in very positive feedback.
I went through each feature of the app directly on an iOS device and briefly described the thought process and reasoning behind certain decisions.
The client mentioned how perfectly I was able to take his idea and form it into a tangible product.

After being able to physically use the app, the client started coming up with more ideas on how the app could be improved.
He loved the visual aesthetic of the app on the iPhone, but mentioned that a separate version for large tablets (iPads) could be very beneficial.

Overall, the client was very happy with the solution.

## Further Development
- Develop a web interface that can be accessed through browsers.
- Allow users to save other types of media other than just images or locations (ie. looped videos, slideshows).
- Third-party service integration; Allowing users to upload media from external services like Dropbox or Google Drive.
- An interface where a user can make modifications to an image like cropping, adding filters etc.
