# Criterion C: Development
> List techniques used in app (ie. classes, methods, navigation stack, file handling, camera, database integration)

## Classes
> Describe how and why classes were used in the app
  and what differs from frontend differs from backend (ie. React components, Mongoose routes).
  Rundown each class, what they accomplish.

## Methods
> How methods were used to accomplish goals.
  Go through some example methods in code.

## Open Source Software

Since there is so much going on in the app, I needed to take advantage of some open-source packages to help ease development
and make sure I wasn't re-inventing the wheel.

- Node.js – Server-side JavaScript environment.
- MongoDB – Cross-platform database.
- Flow – Allows static type checking in JavaScript, this allows me to write code that is easily maintainable.
- Babel – An ES6+ to ES5 transpiler; Allows me to integrate some of the latest and greatest features of JavaScript that aren't yet greatly supported. 
- Express – Used to handle all incoming and outgoing requests for the API.
- Multer – Handles multipart data; saves images onto the server.
- Mongoose – Provides a simple interface to MongoDB.
- Chalk – Colours any outputted logs in the server console.
- Nodemon – Used to run the development server; Listens for changes in code and restarts automatically.
- node-geocoder – Used to resolve coordinate data into readable city and country values.
