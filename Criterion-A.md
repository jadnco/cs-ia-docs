# Criterion A: Planning

## Description of Scenario

The client for this product is an aquaintance of mine. They run their own business, photographing rare and exotic cars around the world. The client was very proud of his work and wanted to share it with the rest of the *automotive enthusiast* world.
He ran into issues using the photo sharing apps out there today – none of them directly catered to the audience he wanted to target.

Knowing I had experience building digital products, the client came to me for ideas on how we could solve this problem. We decided that a mobile automotive photo sharing app would resolve this issue.

## Rationale

The client valued my time and skills so he knew that he would need to set aside some funds to get this project off the ground.
As the client was an individual, their funds were limited. There was no room in the budget for hiring external resources; I had to figure out the most efficient way of creating an app that would run on the two major mobile platforms.

Acknowledging my current skillset, I did some research to see what our options were.
In the end, we decided to go with a framework developed by *Facebook Inc.* called *React Native*. This was a good choice, because I already had experience writing React apps for web platforms – introducing native environments into the equation would be a nice opportunity to challenge myself.
This would allow me to develop the product for iOS first, as I was more comfortable with it, and then eventually Android.

## Criteria for Success

### Requirements
- A database that stores all information and relationships.
- A back-end API service that acts as a link between the front-end interfaces and the database. Every record has to be able to be read, created, updated and deleted.
- An app interface that runs on the latest version of Apple's iOS and provides a straight-forward user experience that could easily be translated to other platforms (Android and Web).
- Camera view that allows a user to take a photo with location data, save it to the device's photo library and then be able to upload it to an external server.
- Users should be able to create Spots with a title, caption, location and some form of media.
- Users should be able to *like* Spots, and *follow* other users.

### Extras (time permitting)
- Develop a web interface that can be accessed through browsers.
- Allow users to save other types of media other than just images (ie. looped videos, slideshows).
- Third-party service integration; Allowing users to upload media from external services like Dropbox or Google Drive.
- An interface where a user can make modifications to an image like cropping, adding filters etc.
- Private messaging between users.
- Allow Users to make comments on Spots and reply to other comments.
